# Task
Find the roots of a quadratic equation.
The program, which runs on the command line with parameters, calculates the values of the roots of the quadratic equation and prints them.
The input to the program is the coefficients a, b and c. Two roots of the quadratic equation are printed. The roots are displayed - each on a new line.
All the coefficients that are supplied to the input are coefficients that eventually give 2 roots of the quadratic equation.
The roots are converted to integer form before being displayed.
